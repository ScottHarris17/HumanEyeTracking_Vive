- Fixed most of the alignment problem with the stimulus
- Did innitial test using the binary red/green noise with and without glassers (Jeremiah). Oscillation period was 20 seconds

For next time:
- Figure out why the stimulus for the glasses experiment drifts when replotted
- Save metadata about the stimulus with the data
- Why is the frame rate 83? Are we dropping frames or is this the true frame rate
- Test, test, test. Try lower contrast, different patterns, slower speeds, faster speeds. Compare red/green to black/white. Will also likely need more repitions per stimulus.
